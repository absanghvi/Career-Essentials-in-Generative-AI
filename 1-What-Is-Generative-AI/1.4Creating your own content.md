## Creating your own content

1. **Creating Content with Generative AI**
    - With a generative AI model and a chassis, you can create your own content.
    - Beginners can use paid services like Midjourney or Lensa.
    - More experienced users can use a notebook and pick from available models.

2. **Using Commercial Apps**
    - Uploading pictures to a commercial app can generate a variety of avatars.

3. **For Experienced Generative AI Users**
    - Choose a favorite generative AI model from GitHub.
    - If the model is not available as a notebook, inquire within the generative AI community.
    - Programmers can create their own notebook using the model code from GitHub.

4. **Running a Notebook**
    - Example: Running a Google Colab notebook named Deforum to generate a fantasy landscape.
    - The notebook runs through the code and produces a personalized outcome based on your settings.
    - Google Colab requires a subscription for minimized generation time.
    - Notebooks offer personalized options for the quality of outcomes.

5. **Summary**
    - A model is a set of algorithms trained on a specific dataset.
    - A notebook is a tool for writing and running the code.
    - A creative application is an example of how a model can be used.
    - The generated outcome is what the end user produces by using a generative AI service or a notebook that houses the model inside it.
