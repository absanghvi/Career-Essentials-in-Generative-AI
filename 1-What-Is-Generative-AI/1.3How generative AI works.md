## How generative AI works

1. **Understanding Generative AI**
    - AI works by being trained on large amounts of content.
    - Generative AI is a subcategory of AI that generates new content.

2. **Generative AI Models**
    - Different generative AI models exist, similar to different car engines.
    - Models are created by specialists and funded by companies and universities.
    - Big players include Open AI, NVIDIA, Google, Meta, UC Berkeley, and LMU Munich.
    - Models can be kept private or made public (open source).

3. **Usage of Generative AI Models**
    - Usage varies based on technical expertise.
    - Three different end users:
        - Business leader: Uses open source models or partners with a corporation to develop a product.
        - Creative person: Picks a pre-made model from a repository like GitHub and Hugging Face, and runs it in an AI notebook like Google Colab or Jupiter Notebooks.
        - Non-technical person: Can benefit from generative AI by subscribing to an online service like OpenAI's ChatGPT or DALL-E, or downloading apps like Midjourney or Lensa AI and Avatar Maker.
		- this all depends what you want to do and what you want to build, and how much technical expertise you already have.
